Since January 2023, I've joined Tmax AI as an AI engineer to build Vision Generative AI models, enabling users to be more productive and accessible.

My research interests are Generative AI, Computer Vision, Neural Network, and Unreal Engine. My ongoing project is focused on productivity improvment of Unreal Engine using Vision Generative AI.

I completed a M.S. student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. Daeeun Kim.

Prior to M.S. course, I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Human Environment and Design, the Cognitive Science, and the Applied Statistics at Yonsei University in 2021.
