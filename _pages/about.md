Since January 2023, I've joined **[Tmax AI](https://tmaxai.co.kr)** as an AI engineer to develop Generative AI models, enabling users to be more productive and accessible.

My research interests are Generative AI, Computer Vision, Neural Network, and Unreal Engine. My ongoing project is focused on productivity improvment of Unreal Engine using Generative AI models.

I completed a M.S. student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at **Yonsei University** in 2023, where I was advised by [Prof. Daeeun Kim](http://cog.yonsei.ac.kr/pages/Cog_Prof.html).

Prior to M.S. course, I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Human Environment and Design, the Cognitive Science, and the Applied Statistics at **Yonsei University** in 2021.
